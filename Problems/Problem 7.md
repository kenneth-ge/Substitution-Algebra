## Problem 7 (technique: what is the function?)

Given the following substitutions:
  ABB <-> AB, AB <-> BA

And the sequence: BBBABBBBB = 3BA5B

What is the minimum value *x* you can get, where x = (the number of Bs left at the end of all your substitutions) + (the number of moves it took to get there)?

## Solution
