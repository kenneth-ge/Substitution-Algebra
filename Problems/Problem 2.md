## Problem 2 (technique: )

So, for this problem, you're given the following sequence, which is a number written in Roman numerals: XVVVVII

Just a quick refresher on Roman numerals: each letter has a specific value, and to get your final answer, you add all of those values up. In this case, X has a value of 10, V has a value of 5, and I has a value of 1. So, the number we're given has a value of 32. 

Your task is to use the following substitutions to get the smallest number you can get strictly greater than 50. So, for example, a value of 49 or 50 would not work, but 51 and 90 would both work. 

Substitutions:
X -> I
V <-> X

## Solution

We can get 51 as follows: XXXXVVI
