## Problem 9 (technique: everything! but also, this problem isn't as complicated as it looks)

  AL <-> LA
  
  AB <-> BA
  
  AC <-> CA
  
  C -> A, C -> L
  
  C -> CC
  
  ALB -> ∅, BLA -> ∅

Using the substitutions above, try to clear the following sequence:
AABLBBLC

## Solution

Function of each letter:

L -> wall

A -> thing that can move between walls

B -> thing that is stuck between walls

C -> wild card

Now we get our answer: AABLBBLC = ABALBBLC = ABBLC = BBLAC = BC = BCC = BAC = BCA = BLA = ∅
