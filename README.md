# Substitution-Algebra
A new field of math we invented with an emphasis on developing problem-solving skills

This repository contains the PDF of our 25-page textbook/seminal paper for Substitution Algebra. To learn more about it, we've put all of our motivations and basic information in the foreword and the introduction of the textbook. If you have any more questions, I'd be super happy to answer them if you leave an issue/pull request or reach out to me at my email. Thanks for checking this out, and I hope you like it. 

Also, if you'd like to add extra questions to this bank, please feel free to make a pull request! Our goal is to have 100 questions by the end of 2021.
