# Substitution-Algebra
A new field of math we invented with an emphasis on developing problem-solving skills

This repository contains the PDF of our 25-page textbook for Substitution Algebra. It also contains a 51-page copy of our book with margins and tables formatted for printing. To learn more about it, we've put all of our motivations and basic information in the foreword and the introduction of the textbook. If you have any questions, I'd be super happy to answer them if you leave an issue/pull request or reach out to me at my email. Thanks for checking this out, and I hope you like it.

Also, if you'd like to add extra questions to this bank, please feel free to make a pull request! Let's build up a good set of instructional problems together!

Note: The print-friendly copy of our book may have slightly different wording and explanations, but the content of both books should be largely the same.
